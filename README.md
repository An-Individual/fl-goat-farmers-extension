This is the Javascript and CSS used in the original [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fallen-london-goat-farmer/biefkddpeaninjbkipkgnncpdlbddkfl) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fallen-london-goat-farmers-ext/?src=search) versions of the Fallen London Goat Farmer's Browser Extension. I've also included examples of the manifests used to create the add-on in each browser.
